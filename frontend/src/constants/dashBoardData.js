    summary: `
        Cybersecurity is crucial in protecting sensitive data, personal information, and critical infrastructure 
        from malicious actors. With the rapid advancement of technology, cyber threats have grown more sophisticated, 
        targeting businesses and individuals alike. Ransomware attacks, data breaches, and phishing schemes are some 
        of the most prevalent threats today. Companies must implement robust security measures, such as encryption, 
        multi-factor authentication, and regular software updates, to safeguard their systems. 
        For individuals, practicing good cyber hygiene—like using strong passwords and being cautious about 
        sharing personal information—is essential in reducing vulnerability to attacks.

  projectDetails: `
      This project is built using a modern MERN stack: MongoDB for the database, Express.js for the backend, 
      React.js for the frontend, and Node.js as the runtime environment. The system operates entirely offline, 
      ensuring maximum security for handling sensitive HR data. The backend includes JWT-based authentication, 
      while the frontend uses React Router for seamless navigation between pages. Secure in-house deployment 
      ensures that no external dependencies are required, adhering to the strict security policies of the organization.
